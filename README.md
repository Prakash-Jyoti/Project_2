# 🌱 Smart Plant Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Plant Monitoring System** is an IoT-based project designed to automate plant care and optimize water usage. Built using the **Rugged Board A5D2X**, the system integrates sensors, actuators, and cloud connectivity to monitor and maintain plant health with minimal manual intervention.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time monitoring** of soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity.
- **Automatic irrigation control** using relay-driven 12V water pump.
- **Sunlight protection** via servo-controlled shading mechanism.
- **Wi-Fi enabled cloud connectivity** using WE10 module.
- **MQTT protocol** for lightweight IoT communication with **Rightech Cloud** dashboards.
- **Energy-efficient design** operating on 12V DC.
- **Scalable and modular** for different agriculture and home-gardening applications.
